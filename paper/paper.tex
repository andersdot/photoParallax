Converting a noisy parallax measurement into a posterior
belief over distance requires inference with a prior.
Usually this prior represents beliefs about the stellar density distribution of
the Milky Way.
However, multi-band photometry exists for a large fraction of the
\gaia\ \tgas\ Catalog and is incredibly informative about stellar distances.
Here we use \tmass\ colors for $1.2$ million \tgas\ stars to build a
noise-deconvolved empirical prior distribution for stars in color--magnitude
space.
This data-driven model contains no knowledge of stellar astrophysics or the
Milky Way, but rather derives its precision from its generative model of noisy
parallax measurements and an assumption of stationarity.
We use the Extreme Deconvolution (\xd) algorithm---an approximation to a full
hierarchical model of the true parallax and photometry of every star---to
construct this prior.
The \xd-optimized prior is used to infer a precise photometric parallax estimate
and uncertainty (and full posterior) for every star.
Our parallax estimates are more precise than the \tgas\ catalog entries by a
median factor of 1.2 (14\% are more precise by a factor $>2$) and are more
precise than previous Bayesian distance estimates that use spatial priors.
We validate our parallax inferences using members of the Milky Way
star cluster M67, which is not visible as a cluster in the \tgas\ parallax
estimates, but appears as a cluster in our posterior parallax estimates.
Our results, including a posterior parallax and distance sampling for 1.4
million \tgas\ stars, are available in companion electronic tables.

\section{Introduction}

The \gaia\ Mission (\citealt{gaia16}) will soon deliver more than a billion
stellar parallax measurements.
Only a small fraction (but large number) of these
measurements will be both precise and purely astrometric.
\gaia\ will use astrometric parallaxes to determine the distances of the more
precise stars, and then calibrate spectrophotometric models.
These spectrophotometric models, in turn, along with \gaia's on-board
low-resolution $B_p\,R_p$ spectrophotometry, are used to provide
parallax estimates to less precise stars.
The full stack required for these parallax inferences is complex.
It involves modeling the stars, as well as the dust in the Milky Way,
and the response of the telescope itself.
It might be possible to eliminate some of this complexity using data driven models which don't rely on physical models.

Projects like \project{The Cannon} (\citealt{ness15}; \citealt{casey17}; \citealt{ho17})
and \project{Avast} (Bedell et al.\ in preparation),
explore the extent to which our predictive models of
stars could be purely data-driven or statistical.
That is, under what circumstances could the data themselves deliver
more precise or more accurate information than any theoretical or
physics-based model?
The answer to this question is extremely context-dependent: It depends
on what data are available, how much data are available, and what
questions are being asked.
In general, data-driven models contain fewer assumptions than
physics-driven models, but they are also usually less interpretable.
However, the \gaia\ data set is ideal for thinking about purely statistical
models of stars:
The different stars observed by \gaia\ are measured at very different
signal-to-noise ratios.
A data-driven model of the stellar color--magnitude distribution can capitalize
on the precise information coming from the high signal-to-noise stars
and deliver valuable information about the low signal-to-noise stars,
which in turn will deliver precise parallax (or distance or absolute magnitude) inferences.

Here we deliver a demonstration-of-concept that shows that a
data-driven model of the \gaia\ data could in principle deliver very
precise parallax measurements, without any input of the physics or numerical models of stellar
evolution, interiors, or photospheres.
That is, this is a data-driven or purely empirical \emph{photometric
  parallax} method.
A photometric parallax is a parallax (or distance) estimate based on
the photometry (colors and apparent magnitude or magnitudes) of a
star.
Fundamentally, photometric parallaxes capitalize on the fact that the
apparent magnitude of a star is a strong function of distance, and
that the absolute magnitude is a strong function of color (or surface
temperature) and evolutionary stage.

Most stellar models used to generate photometric
parallaxes have been \emph{physical} models, based on gravity, fluid mechanics,
radiative transfer, nuclear reactions, and atomic and molecular transitions.
Because there are small issues with each of these components, the models are inaccurate in detail, and
the physical models therefore produce parallax (and hence distance) estimates that are biased.
In addition, they build a long list of physical assumptions (about
nuclear reactions, convection, and thermal timescales, for example)
into the parallax estimates.
When using physical models, it is impossible to deliver photometric parallax estimates that involve minimal assumptions.

However, the use of physical models for distance estimation is not necessary.
It is possible to build a stellar photometric model from the data themselves,
because there are stars at all luminosities with useful parallax information.
One challenge is that different stars are observed at different levels of parallax precision,
so it requires relatively sophisticated technology to build this data-driven model
using all of the data available, fairly and responsibly.

Here we build and use just such a data-driven model to infer more precise parallaxes for each star.
In particular, we use all of the \gaia\ \tgas\ data (\citealt{tgas};
these data were generated by the methodology of \citealt{michalik15}), that match to the
\tmass\ photometry (\citealt{skrutskie06}) and lie in the footprint of
the \panstarrs\ Dust Map (\citealt{green15}), to make a model of the
noise-free (or low-noise) color--magnitude diagram (\cmd) of stars.
We build the \cmd\ using an Empirical-Bayes approach known as Extreme Deconvolution (XD;
\citealt{bovy11}).
This method deconvolves heteroskedastic data to derive an
estimate of the noise-free or low-noise distribution that \emph{would
  have} been observed with far better data.
This method has been used in astrophysics
previously to model the velocity distribution of stars in the Solar
Neighborhood (\citealt{hogg05}; \citealt{bovy09}) and to
perform quasar target selection
in \project{Sloan Digital Sky Survey} data (\citealt{xdqso}; \citealt{xdqsoz}).
Its advantage over other deconvolution methods is that it takes as input,
and handles in a principled way, heteroskedastic data.
Its disadvantage, for the present purposes, is that it requires
or implies a strictly Gaussian noise model.
As we show below, this requires us to transform the \cmd\ to a space in which
the noise is approximately Gaussian.

We then use the novel \xd\ output---the deconvolved \cmd---as
a prior for use in inference of individual-star parallaxes.
These inferences, one per star, provide much more precise parallax, distance,
or absolute magnitude estimates than we get from each star's primary
\tgas\ parallax measurement alone.
That is, we are using the \xd\ model to de-noise the \gaia\ parallax
measurements.
Technically, since \xd\ produces a maximum-marginalized-likelihood estimator
of the deconvolved distribution,
its use as a prior is technically using the data twice and is therefore only approximately valid.
However, since the data set is large, the \xd\ approximation is not bad; it is
sometimes known as the ``empirical Bayes'' method, and is well studied.\footnote{For a primer on ``empirical Bayes'', see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_Bayes_method}.}

A probabilistically valid approach that wouldn't re-use the data is to perform
a full hierarchical Bayesian inference.
Exploration of that possibility, and its computational tractability,
is among our long-term goals and motivations.
Along those lines, this paper can be seen as a companion to a related
project \citep{leistedtHogg2017}, in which we use a slightly less appropriate
model for the \cmd, but in which we take a much more principled
approach to the inference.

Although not a fully Bayesian hierarchical inference, the methodology presented in this paper makes exceedingly weak assumptions
about the Milky Way, and similarly weak assumptions about the properties of
stars.
To date, there has been some discussion in the literature
about how to use a parallax responsibly to infer a distance (\citealt{astraatmadja16a}; \citealt{astraatmadja16b}).
These papers use the \gaia\ measurement to construct a parallax likelihood,
and combine this with a distance prior.
While this is sensible and correct, all present methods proposed along
these lines build in informative (and known-to-be-wrong) assumptions
about the line-of-sight distance distribution to \gaia\ stars.
That is, they build in strong and informative assumptions about the Milky
Way.
The strongest new assumption made in this work is that for every star
in \tgas, there are other, photometrically (and bolometrically)
similar stars.
That is a much weaker assumption than has been made in most other Bayesian
distance estimations.

This project is fundamentally a demonstration of concept:
We are only using a subset of the ``small'' (relative to the expected final \gaia\ data set)
\tgas\ Catalog.
We are performing only an approximation to full Bayesian hierarchical inference.
We have to use photometry that is ground-based, rather than the full-precision,
space-based photometry that the \gaia\ Mission will deliver.
However, as we show below, we get very good results in terms of parallax precision.
It is promising that we will be able to obtain even better results
using later \gaia\ data releases, and eventually infer distances for $>10^9$
\gaia\ stars using photometric parallax methodologies but without any
commitment to---or even use of---physical models of stars or the Milky Way.

\section{Why does this work?}
\begin{figure}

The upper-left panel visualizes the simplified toy distribution. The red lines are the $1\sigma$ contours of the distribution, and the red points are 1024 samples from the distribution. These same $1\sigma$ contours are drawn in the bottom left panel. In the upper-right and lower-left panel, the grey points are these same 1024 samples of the distribution but with some measurement uncertainty added to them. The error bars show the $1\sigma$ measurement uncertainties. The black points are 5 randomly chosen data to highlight the method. In the lower-left panel, the blue lines represent the noise deconvolved, best estimate for the underlying distribution. The blue points represent the posterior belief of the true values of the noisy black points using the noise deconcolved distribution as the prior. The red points represent the actual true values. The lower-right panel shows the posterior belief of the true value for all the points. They are colored by the measurement uncertainty, showing that data with larger measured variance are more influenced by the prior and lie towards the center of the noise deconvolved distribution, or prior. In contrast, more certain measurements tend to lie closer to their measured value. The blue points are better than the black for doing stuff.}
\label{fig:toy}
\end{figure}

In this paper we use the noise-deconvolved \cmd\ as a prior to infer more precise parallax probability distribution functions (pdfs) from \gaia\ measurements.
Understanding the validity of this method can be challenging because we are using the data both for the prior and the likelihood in our inference.
To ease understanding, here we demonstrate the generaly methodology using a
simpler toy model with simulated data.
Instead of inferring parallax pdfs using the 2D distribution of the \cmd\ as our prior, for this simpler model we will infer posterior pdfs of the value $Y$.
We perform this simpler inference using a prior that is also a 2D distribution: a 1D Gaussian in the y-direction, with a running mean $\mu = m\,x + b$ and some thickness $t$.
Here the thickness of the toy distribution mimics the true thickness or intrinsic scatter of the \cmd\ due to age, mass, and metallicity.
The $1\sigma$ contours as well as (noise free) samples from the toy model distribution are shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:toy}, upper-left panel.
Similarly, noisy samples from this distribution are shown in the upper-right panel.
Using a representation of the true distribution (which we learn from the noisy data) as our prior, we can infer some posterior belief over $y_{\true,n}$, a true sample from the distribution, from $y_n$, a sample from the noise distribution.

Setting up the problem in more detail, we have the true samples from the underlying distribution and the noisy samples
\begin{eqnarray}
y_{\true, n} \, &=& \, m_{\true}\,x_n + b_{\true} + \Delta_n \\
y_n \, &=& \, y_{\true,n} + \epsilon_n \quad,
\label{eq:ytrue}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta_n$ is drawn from the Gaussian function $\mathcal{N}(\Delta_n \given 0, t^2)$---which accounts for the intrinsic width---and $\epsilon_n$ is drawn from the Gaussian function $\mathcal{N}(\epsilon_n \given 0, \sigma_n^2)$---the noise distribution---so $\sigma_n$ is the measurement uncertainty.
These represent true and noisy draws from a distribution that is a straight line with some thickness $t$, and are visualized in the upper panels of \figurename~\ref{fig:toy}.
The upper-left shows 1024 realizations of the true values, and the upper-right, as well as lower-left, show 1024 realizations of the noisy values $y_n$ and their associated measurement uncertainties $\sigma_n$ as the grey points; we highlight 5 random points in black.

To infer a posterior pdf of the true $y$ value for each measured $y$ value we need a prior. We use an estimate of the underlying true distribution that the noisy data $y_n$ are drawn from, which we build from the noisy $y$ data themselves.
We learn the noise-deconvolved function using marginalized, maximum-likelihood estimation (MMLE), which marginalizes over the true data values and maximizes the likelihood of the data. Here our likelihood for each individual datum is
\begin{eqnarray}
p(y_n \given m, b, t^2, \sigma_n^2) \ &=& \ \int \mathcal{N}(y_n \given y_{\true,n}, \sigma_n^2) \, \mathcal{N}(y_{\true,n} \given m\,x_n + b, t^2 ) \, \mathrm{d}y_{\true, n} \\
&=&  \ \mathcal{N}(y_n \given m\,x_n + b, t^2 + \sigma_n^2) \quad,
\label{eq:toyLike}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have marginalized over the true sample $y_{\true, n}$. The resulting likelihood is a Gaussian because the noise model and our assumptions about the intrinsic width are both Gaussian. The likelihood of the full data set $\{y_n\}$ is then the product of the individual likelihoods
\begin{equation}
p(\{y_n\} \given m, b, t^2, \sigma_n^2) = \prod_n\, p(y_n \given m, b, t^2, \sigma_n^2) \quad .
\label{eq:toyLikeFull}
\end{equation}
Maximizing this joint likelihood of all the data is the same as minimizing
\begin{equation}
\chi^2 = \sum_n \frac{[y_n - [m\,x_n + b]]^2}{[\sigma_n^2 + t_n^2]} + \sum_n\,\ln(2\pi\,[\sigma_n^2 + t^2])
\quad .
\label{eq:chisq}
\end{equation}

The MMLE gives us the best fit parameters $\hat{m}$, $\hat{b}$, and $\hat{t}$. In \figurename~\ref{fig:toy}, lower-left panel, the true functions $y_{\true} = m_{\true}\,x + b_{\true} \pm t_{\true}$ are shown as the red lines, and the best fit MMLE functions $\hat{y}_{\true} = \hat{m}\, x + \hat{b} \pm \hat{t}$ are shown as the blue lines. Now that we have an estimate of the true underlying distribution $\hat{y}_{\true}$, we use this as a prior to infer a posterior belief of the true values for each datum $p(y_{\true,n} \given y_n, \tilde{\sigma}_n^2)$.

Here is a good point to step back and acknowledge that our method is a
bit strange. We are using the data to determine the
noise-deconvolved distribution (an estimate of the true
distribution), and then using that noise-deconvolved distribution to
make inferences about the data. We are technically using the data
twice! To be fully, technically correct, we should \emph{either} learn the true
distribution while leaving one datum out, the one datum we want to
infer the true y value for, or else perform a full hierarchical Bayesian inference,
in which we treat the \cmd\ parameters probabilistically along with everything else.
With large data sets, the MMLE or Empirical Bayes approximation is safe,
in some sense because no individual data point makes a large difference to
the inference.

Returning to the inference:
We use Bayes' theorem to turn the likelihood of the noisy data into a posterior belief over the true $y$ value:
\begin{eqnarray}
p(y_{\true,n} \given y_n, \tilde{\sigma}_n) &=& p(y_n \given y_{\true,n}, \sigma_n)\,p(y_{\true,n}) \\
\mathrm{where}\;p(y_n \given y_{\true,n}, \sigma_n) &=& \mathcal{N}(y_n \given y_{\true,n}, \sigma_n) \\
\mathrm{and}\;p(y_{\true,n}) &=& \mathcal{N}(y_{\true,n} \given \hat{m}\, x_n + \hat{b}, \hat{t})
\label{eq:toyBayes}
\end{eqnarray}
In \figurename~\ref{fig:toy} lower-left panel, the blue points represent the posterior beliefs of the true values $y_{\true,n}$ for the 5 highlighted black points from the upper-right panel. The red points are the associated true $y$ values.
In the lower-right panel of \figurename~\ref{fig:toy}, the blue points show the expectation value and $1\sigma$ uncertainty of the posterior belief for all 1024 $y_n$.
When the true values are inferred in this way, the associated variance $\tilde{\sigma}_n^2$ is the convolution of the true distribution variance, $t^2$, and the measurement variance, $\sigma_n^2$.
The points are colored by their measurement variance $\sigma_n^2$, which shows that noisier measurements are more influenced by the prior and get pulled closer to the center of the MMLE distribution, our prior. In contrast, more certain measurements remain closer to their measured values, $y_n$. We now have better estimates of each true y value by inferring each true y value from the measured y value and using an estimate of the true distribution the measured y value was drawn from as the prior.

In detail, the posterior points shown in the lower-right panel of
Figure~\ref{fig:toy} look more concentrated (vertically) than the true
values shown in the upper-left panel.
This is because the points in the lower-right (posterior) panel show
not typical values or typical draws from the posterior; they show the
modes (and, with error bars, the variances) of the posterior pdfs.
When an original data point has a large variance, the posterior ends
up close to the prior, which has a mode at the center line; the
posterior modes therefore concentrate more towards the center line
than any representative sampling.
A plot of posterior samplings (as opposed to a plot of posterior modes) would
show a scatter like that in the upper-left (truth) panel.

Bringing the toy model back to our original problem:
We can get better estimates of the true parallax for each star by inferring the true parallax from the measured parallax and using the noise-deconvolved \cmd, an estimate of the true \cmd, as our prior.

\section{Assumptions and methods}\label{sec:method}

To infer the true parallax for a star using the noise-deconvolved \cmd\ as
a prior, we make the following assumptions. The method we present is correct
and justifiable under these assumptions, each of which is questionable
in its own right. We return to criticize these assumptions---and the
method that flows from them---in the discussion section below.
\begin{description}
\item[stationarity] We make an assumption of \emph{stationarity}; that is, that the
  stars measured at lower signal-to-noise have analogs measured at
  higher signal-to-noise.
  In detail, this assumption is wrong, (for example, distant halo stars are different than local
  disk stars), but the stationarity assumption is fairly weak:
  The requirement is that, locally in the \cmd, there is
  support among the high signal-to-noise stars for the types
  of stars also seen at low signal-to-noise.
  If this requirement is met, the results will not be
  strongly biased. Although this is a weak assumption, it is deep and fundamental to this
  work.
\item[selection] We have no model for the selection function of \tgas,
  nor selection volumes for any kinds of stars.
  For this reason, we are building a model of \emph{the contents of \tgas}, not the
  properties of the stars in the Milky Way (nor any volume-limited component or region
  thereof).
\item[big data] We assume that we have large numbers of stars, large enough that
  empirical Bayes, or maximum-marginalized likelihood, is a safe
  approximation to full Bayesian inference. This assumption will be
  least true in the least-populated parts of the \cmd. In the extreme
  case, if a portion of the \cmd\ has only one (statistically distinct)
  exemplar---for example, a white dwarf---inference for these cases will be biased.
\item[noise model] We assume that the \tgas\ parallax uncertainties dominate the
  noise in any estimates of absolute magnitude. We further assume that
  the parallax and color uncertainties are Gaussian in form with
  correctly known variances. In detail, we assume that the parallax uncertainty estimates,
  (the \texttt{parallax{\_}error} entry in the \gaia\ catalog), are correct.
  Here we are making use of the fact that, for
  de-noising, under-estimation of measurement noise is conservative, and leads to under-deconvolution. In other words, the features of the inferred \cmd\ will typically be broader and more conservatively estimated than than if we over-estimated the noise.
\item[dust] We treat the \panstarrs-based three-dimensional dust maps (\citealt{green15})
  as correct in their median dust estimates, and their
  effects on color and magnitude. As we optimize the empirical Bayes model, we iteratively update each star's
  dust correction at its updated, inferred distance. Our assumption is that these corrections are
  good enough, and uncertainties in these are not dominant, for neither
  color nor absolute magnitude.
\item[mixture of Gaussians] We assume that the \cmd\ can be represented by a mixture of
  Gaussians in a particular transformed space. This mixture we fix
  (with only heuristic analysis) at 128 Gaussians.
\item[no physics] We make no use of stellar models; our only assumptions about
  stellar physics are generic and implicit (for example, that the
  \cmd\ is somehow smooth and compact).
\end{description}

\subsection{Setting up the Inference}

Under these assumptions, we would like to infer the true parallax, $\varpi_{\true}$, for each star given its measured parallax, $\varpi$, and associated uncertainty, $\sigma_{\varpi}$, from \tgas.
A first application of Bayes theorem leads to
\begin{equation}
p(\varpi_{\true} \given \varpi, \sigma^2_{\varpi}) = \frac{1}{Z}\,p(\varpi \given \varpi_{\true}, \sigma^2_{\varpi}) \, p(\varpi_{\true}) \quad ,
\label{eq:bayes}
\end{equation}
where $p(\varpi \given \varpi_{\true}, \sigma^2_{\varpi})$ is the likelihood of the observed parallax, $p(\varpi_{\true})$ is a prior pdf for the true
parallax, and $Z$ is a normalization constant (the model evidence, or marginalized likelihood).
The strength of our inference lies in how we generate our prior.
Instead of assuming a functional form for the spatial distribution of stars in the Milky Way (\citealt{astraatmadja16b}), or relying on stellar models (\citealt{gaia16}), we build a noise-deconvolved estimate of the \cmd\ from the observed colors and absolute magnitudes of our full set of stars.
This is because supplementary to the trigonometric measure of distance, the photometry of stars is also informative of their distances.
The intrinsic temperatures and luminosities of stars tightly correlate leading to the observed colors and absolute magnitudes of stars also tightly correlating, usually visualized as the \cmd.
The tight correlation of the \cmd\ benefits our inference because the luminosity or absolute magnitude of a star $M$, when compared with its brightness or apparent magnitude $m$, contains distance information $d$ via the fundamental relation $m=M+5\log(d/10\, \mathrm{pc})$.
We include this in the inference by using the \cmd\ as part of our prior for $\varpi_{\true}$.
Specifically, we use the \cmd\ generated from the data themselves, as detailed in the next section.

Equation~\ref{eq:bayes} does not fully specify this procedure.
Because our prior comes from the \cmd, our inference will include not only the parallax from \gaia, but also the photometry of the stars. Specifically, we use the $J$ and $K$ band photometry from \tmass, as well as the parallax from \gaia. Our true, latent values are the $(J-K)^{true}_n$ color and the $J$ band absolute magnitude $M^{true}_{J,n}$ for each star, which we encapsulate in the true vector $\mathbf{Y}$. The observed data is the dust corrected color $(J-K)^c_n$, the \gaia\ parallax $\varpi_n$ in units of $[mas]$, and the dust corrected $J$ band magnitude $J^c_n$, which we encapsulate in the data vector $\mathbf{y}$.

We now describe a singularity of our method, which allows us to conservatively deconvolve the data into a \cmd\ prior without requiring a full hierarchical inference framework (which was explored in \citealt{leistedtHogg2017}).
Instead of transforming the parallax and apparent magnitude into an absolute magnitude, the data vector $\mathbf{y}$ contains a transformation of the dust corrected absolute magnitude
\begin{equation}
y_0 = \varpi\,10^{\frac{1}{5}\,J^c_n} = 10^{\frac{1}{5}\,M^c_{J,n} + 2}
\label{eq:transform}
\end{equation}
where, for this expression, it is important to remember that $\varpi$ is assumed to be in units of $[mas]$.
The transformation of the dust corrected absolute magnitude is required to to keep the uncertainties Gaussian, which, under some assumptions along with this transformation, we maintain (Gaussian uncertainties are required to use \xd, see below).
Our prior assumptions $I$ are the uncertainties in each of these measurements, as well as the 3D dust map. So our full terminology is
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{true \, vector} \quad &\mathbf{Y}_n = [10^{0.2\,M^{true}_{J,n} + 2}, (J-K)^{true}_n] \\
\mathrm{data \, vector} \quad &\mathbf{y}_n = [\varpi_n\,10^{0.2J^c_n}, (J- K)^c_n] \;\hspace*{15mm}  n \in \mathrm{stars} \\
\mathrm{with \; apparent \; magnitude} \quad &J^c_n = J_n - Q_J\,E(B-V)_n \\
\mathrm{and \; color} \quad &(J - K)^c_n = J_n - K_n - Q_{JK}\,E(B-V)_n \\
\mathrm{under\ the\ assumptions} \quad &I_n = \left\{\left\{\sigma^2_{\varpi, n}\right\}, \left\{\sigma^2_{J,n}\right\}, \left\{\sigma^2_{K,n}\right\}, \mathrm{Dust \, Map}\right\}
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:data}
\end{equation}
where $E(B-V)_n$ is the output of the dust model of \cite{green15}, and $Q_{\lambda}$ is the correction factor for a photometric band assuming some reddening law.

We assume that the parallax likelihood is Gaussian, as well as the $(J-K)^c_n$ color likelihood. So our full likelihood for the $n$th star is
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{y}_n \given \mathbf{Y}_n, I_n) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{y}_n \given \mathbf{Y}_n, V_n)
\end{equation}

V_n = \begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{J,n}^2 + \sigma_{K,n}^2 & 0 \\
0 & \left(\sigma_{\varpi}\,10^{0.2\,J_n^C}\right)^2
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma})$ represents a normal distribution with mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and covariance matrix $\mathbf{\Sigma}$.
Here we have assumed that the parallax uncertainty is significantly larger than the $J$-band magnitude uncertainty and is therefore the dominant uncertainty in the transformed absolute magnitude. We take $J_n^C$ as a point estimate and only propagate the parallax uncertainty.

We can now write the multidimensional posterior expression analogous to Equation~\ref{eq:bayes},
\begin{equation}
p(\mathbf{Y}_n \given \mathbf{y}_n, I_n) \propto p(\mathbf{y}_n \given \mathbf{Y}_n, I_n) \, p(\mathbf{Y}_n) \label{eq:posterior}
\end{equation}
where $p(\mathbf{y}_n \given \mathbf{Y}_n, I_n)$ is the likelihood of the data vector, and $p(\mathbf{Y}_n)$ is our prior.
Before we describe how this can be turned into a posterior belief on the true parallax, we turn our attention to the prior, which will be generated from the data themselves. For this, we use XD, which takes advantage of the Gaussian likelihood.

\subsection{Generating the Prior}

To generate the empirical prior $p(\mathbf{Y}_n)$, we fit our data in the transformed \cmd\ space (see previous sub-section) using \xd, which deconvolves the data $\{ \mathbf{Y}_n \}$ with heterogeneous, Gaussian noise variances $\{ V_n\}$. \xd\ generates an estimate of the underlying distribution from which the uncertain data were drawn, modeled as a mixture of $K$ Gaussians:
\begin{equation}
	p\bigl(\ \mathbf{Y} \given  \left\{A_k, \mathbf{\mu}_k, V_k\right\}_{k=1}^K \bigr) = \sum_{k=1}^K A_k \ \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{Y} \given \mathbf{\mu}_k, V_k )
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{\mu}_k$ and $V_k$ are a two dimensional vector and matrix, respectively, which correspond to the location and covariance of the $k$th component (a Gaussian in our transformed \cmd\ space). The relative amplitudes between the components are described by the scalars $\{ A_k \}$.

Given the data $\{ \mathbf{Y}_n, V_n\}$, \xd\ maximizes the marginalized likelihood of the data, marginalizing over the true data. Assuming $\alpha = \left\{A_k, \mathbf{\mu}_k, V_k\right\}_{k=1}^K$, it finds the coefficients
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{\alpha} &=& \argmax_{\alpha} \, \prod_n \, p(\mathbf{y}_n \given \alpha) \nonumber\\
             &=& \argmax_{\alpha} \, \prod_n \, \int p(\mathbf{y}_n \given \mathbf{Y}_n) \, p(\mathbf{Y}_n \given \alpha)\mathrm{d\mathbf{Y}_n}
\label{eq:xdmml}
\end{eqnarray}
which is made analytically tractable with the Gaussian likelihood and mixture-of-Gaussians prior \citep{bovy11}.

\subsection{Back to the Inference}

To infer $\varpi_{\true}$ once the \cmd\ prior is constructed, we first do the inference in the 2D space of the \cmd\ prior $p(\mathbf{Y} \given \alpha)$, using Equation \ref{eq:posterior}. We then project the 2D posterior into the 1D transformed absolute magnitude space, and do a little algebra to solve for $\varpi_{\true}$

\begin{eqnarray}
p(\mathbf{Y}_0 \given \mathbf{y}, \alpha) &\rightarrow& p(\varpi_{\true} \given y, \alpha) \, f(\varpi_{\true}) \\
\mathrm{where} \; f(\varpi_{\true}) &=& \begin{cases}
              1 \quad \mathrm{if} \quad -2 < \mathrm{log}_{10} \varpi_{true} < 2\\
              0 \quad \mathrm{otherwise}
              \end{cases}
\label{eq:parallaxPost}
\end{eqnarray}
with $f(\varpi_{true})$ being a window function to insure $\varpi_{\true}$ is positive and to put $\varpi_{\true}$ on a similar grid for all the posteriors.

\section{Data and results}
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{data.png}
\caption{The observed \cmd: To visualize the full dataset, in the left panel we use the point estimates of the \tmass\ $J-K$ color, the $J$ band apparent magnitude, and the \gaia\ parallax. The blue lines represent the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ contours for the distribution. To give a sense of the uncertainties, in the right panel we subsample the dataset and include the $1\sigma$ uncertainties. The uncertainties are dominated by the parallax noise, with many stars diverging to infinitely far away and therefore very intrinsically bright.}
\label{fig:data}
\end{figure}

We use stars crossmatched in \tgas\ and \tmass\, that also lie within the
observing footprint of \panstarrs\ to access the \cite{green15} 3D dust model.
We require that the photometry have real values, and nonzero, real errors, and
remove a small selection of \tmass\ stars that have zero color and zero $J$-band
magnitude.
The full data set is visualized in the \cmd\ in \figurename~\ref{fig:data}.
The left panel shows the point estimates of the color and absolute magnitude,
using the point estimate of the parallax from \gaia, and the $1\sigma$ and
$2\sigma$ contours of the distribution.
The right panel shows a subset of the data with it's associated error bars.
The uncertainties in the colors are fairly well behaved, but the large
uncertainties in some absolute magnitudes are due to the large uncertainties in
the parallax measurements.

\subsection{Dust}

For the generation of the prior and the evaluation of the likelihood, we need to
correct the \tmass\ photometry for dust extinction.
With the emergence of 3D dust maps, it is now possible to estimate dust
corrections to stars within the Milky Way. The challenge is getting a
proper estimate of the distance to the star before inferring
$\varpi_{\true}$, since we need a dust correction prior to doing our
inference. Dust corrections are particularly non trivial for stars
with poor parallax signal to noise. Stars with poor signal to noise
have a likelihood that is consistent with infinite distance and can
therefore have severe dust corrections. This is most obvious in the
giant stars, which tend to have the lowest signal to noise, and can
therefore have dust corrections $> 2$ magnitudes. Although the dust
model is probabilistic, as well as our distance inference, to move
forward, we break from a fully Bayesian framework in which we might
infer the distance and the dust simultaneously (more about this in the
discussion). Instead, we correct for dust using a point estimate from
the 3D dust map \citep{green15} sampled at a distance estimated from
iteratively inferring and then sampling our posterior pdf over
$\varpi_{\true}$. In more detail, to apply a dust correction to the
\tmass\ photometry, we first generate our prior using the observed,
attenuated photometry. Using this raw prior, we infer more precise
parallaxes to all the stars in our sample. We then use this more
precise parallax posterior to get a measurement of dust in the 3D dust
map for each star. We then iterate this procedure. This approach minimizes severe
distances, and their associated severe dust corrections, which would
occur if using the likelihoods alone.

In detail, we take the $5\%$
quantile of each distance posterior (the closest part of the
distance posterior) and query the 3D dust map at that distance.
We take the $5\%$ quantile---as apposed to the median---to do a minimal dust
correction because over-correcting for dust can push the peak of the likelihood
function into an unphysical, different space of the \cmd\ and thus bias the
parallax inference.
For each distance, we sample the median of the
probabilistic dust model. We apply each dust correction to our
\tmass\ photometry using Equation~\ref{eq:data}, where $Q_{\lambda}
= [0.709, 0.302]$ for bands $[J, K]$ respectively (see Table 6 in
\citealt{schlafly11}).
We then regenerate our prior using the dust-corrected photometry.
The dust values we obtain in our final
iteration, and which we apply to our photometry, are visualized in
galactic coordinates in \figurename~\ref{fig:dust}.
After applying the dust correction, we do not update the uncertainties, which is
technically wrong and under-represents the true uncertainties; as mentioned
previously, this leads to a less severe deconvolution.
In other words, the features of our inferred
  \cmd\ are conservatively broad (broader than if we over-estimated
  the errors which would have lead to excessive deconvolution and
  unrealistically narrow features). We could add the covariance of
the dust to our likelihoods, but this is beyond the scope of this
demonstration of concept. We iterate this process 10 times, however
the dust values seem to converge after about 2-3 iterations. The
iterative process allows for slight variations in distance and
corresponding dust to become more consistent with the \cmd.
\begin{figure}

\caption{The converged dust values at the 5\% distance quantile in Galactic coordinates. This shows both the footprint of our analysis as well as the adopted extinction values. Each point represents a single star in our cross matched catalog. The large missing areas are due to the \panstarrs\ footprint ($>-30~{\rm deg}$ in declination)}
\label{fig:dust}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The empirical prior}
Using \xd\ and the MMLE method described in the methods section, we generate the
prior, shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:prior}.
The left panel shows 1.3 million samples from the prior distribution, and the
right panel shows $1\sigma$ contours for each component in the underlying
Gaussian mixture model.
Compared to the raw data in \figurename~\ref{fig:data}, the deconvolved
color--magnitude diagram for the \gaia\ + \tmass\ stars is tighter, as expected.
We'll come back to more features in the data below, especially those seen in the posterior distribution.
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{prior_ngauss128.png}
\caption{The \cmd\ prior, modeled as a Gaussian mixture inferred by
  running XD on all of the data. The left panel shows a sampling of
  the prior, with the blue lines showing the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$
  contours. The right panel shows the 1-$\sigma$ contours of the
  individual components. The latter are Gaussian in the transformed
  magnitude space to make the XD inference tractable. Thus, they
  appear as slightly deformed ellipses in color--magnitude space.}
\label{fig:prior}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Shrinkage of parallax uncertainties}

Figure~\ref{fig:posterior} shows the end result of our inference for a few randomly-chosen objects: the posterior pdf on the true parallaxes.
We also show the likelihood and the prior.
In all cases, the prior information brought by the \cmd\ is significant, and leads to a compelling decrease in the parallax uncertainty.
The nature of our prior is also visible: it is apparent that it is made of a mixture of components, and that its impact strongly depend on the location of each object in \cmd\ space.

Figure~\ref{fig:posteriorCMD} shows the distribution of the posterior parallax inferences derived with our \cmd\ prior.
This is further illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:delta}, where we show the fractional changes, and highlight the regions of \cmd\ space with the greatest improvement.
Those typically are the regions with the largest photometric and parallax errors, for the faintest objects.
This is a fairly standard result: the deconvolution of uncertainties is stronger in noisier regions of the data, leading to narrower features in the upper part of the \cmd, for example.
\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{posterior.png}

\caption{The expectation values of the posterior inferences (and error
  bars for a sub-sample). Notice that some parts of this \cmd\ are
  tighter than the prior, or noise-deconvolved \cmd. The visual of the
  prior is a sampling of the Gaussians, but this is the expectation
  value so this lies much closer to the center of the
  distribution. Similar to the toy model, where the pdf maximum of the
  noisier points lies in the center of the distribution.}

The median fractional change is 1.2. Some posteriors have significantly smaller variances shown in black, but some actually increase in variance, shown as the yellow bump at $(J-K)^C$ of about 0.6.

\subsection{Data products}

The method produces a mixture-of-Gaussian parallax posterior pdf for every
star in the intersection of \tgas, \tmass, and the dust map.
Associated with this paper is an electronic table containing our results, and everything
that is necessary to use them responsibly.
It includes the \tgas\ identifier, the \gaia\ identifier, sky position, and dust-corrected
photometry.
It contains posterior expectations and variances for the stellar parallax.
It also contains the full posterior pdf for each star, in the form of a set of pdf values,
evaluated on a common grid in parallax.
Because all of the data are public, and all of the code used for this project is available
publicly under an open-source license, power users can generate any of the figures in this
paper or any other data outputs straightforwardly.

\subsection{Distances to M67}
As a test of the accuracy of these photometric parallax inferences, we inferred the parallaxes to stars in the open cluster M67.
M67 is at a Heliocentric distance of $800$--$900~{\rm pc}$ with an estimated age of 3--$5~{\rm Gyr}$.
Previous work \citep{cbj15} has noted that bad things happen if you try to infer a distance as the inverse of the observed (noisy) parallax when the parallax signal-to-noise (SN) is below 5, $\varpi / \sigma_\varpi < 5$.
With \gaia\ parallaxes having a minimum uncertainty of about $0.3~{\rm mas}$, the SN reaches 5 for the most certain parallax measurements at about $700~{\rm pc}$, just before the distance to this cluster.
M67 is therefore a great test case for comparing parallax inferences with or without a prior.

We select sources from our catalog within a $1~{\rm deg}^2$ square window centered on the position of M67; the cluster is visible as an over-density of stars in the sky positions alone.
With our converged dust values, and its associated prior, we calculate the posterior over $\varpi_{\true}$ for each star within this window on the sky around M67.
\figurename~\ref{fig:m67} shows the comparison of the likelihoods and posteriors.
The vertical lines bracket the previously measured parallaxes of, or distances to, the cluster.
The likelihoods of the observed parallaxes, shown in the top row, are broad and the cluster is not at all obvious.
The posterior pdfs, shown in the bottom row, are more sharply peaked at the previously determined distance to the cluster (vertical lines) for far more stars.
Our prior is not only making parallaxes more precise but also (possibly) increasing the accuracy.

\section{Discussion}

We have shown that it is possible to obtain photometric parallaxes for
distant stars in the \gaia\ \tgas\ catalog without any use of physical stellar
models, nor stellar density models of the Milky Way.
We used the geometric parallaxes to calibrate a photometric
model that is purely statistical, which is a model of the data rather than
a model of stars \foreign{per se}.
This opens up the possibility of completing the goals of the \gaia\ Mission
without building in unnecessary assumptions about the mechanical properties
of stars or the Galaxy.

We obtained the photometric parallaxes in this project
by building a data-driven model of \cmd\ of the stars in the \tgas\ data set,
and using it as a prior pdf for Bayesian inference.
The posterior pdfs for distance that we obtain are, in general, much
narrower than the likelihood functions delivered by the
\gaia\ Mission, and therefore the distance estimates (or,
equivalently, parallax estimates) are much more precise.
It is not surprising that a Bayesian inference provides more
precise inferences than the likelihood function alone; Bayesian
inferences bring in new information that decrease variance (but
can introduce bias).
We have shown that, in addition to pure precision improvements, at
least some aspects of \emph{accuracy} have been improved as well:
The posterior distance estimates to stars in (at least one) stellar
cluster are much more clustered than likelihood-based distance
estimates.

Although we have not performed principled hierarchical Bayesian inference in this
project, we built our prior for each star's parallax by
performing a statistically responsible deconvolution
of the \gaia\ \tgas\ data that is justifiable under a clear set of
assumptions.
This deconvolution, using a reasonable noise model and an
assumption of stationarity, shrinks the parallax uncertainties, most dramatically for the stars measured at lower signal-to-noise.
Because the method we use, \xd, which is
an Empirical Bayesian maximum-marginalized-likelihood estimator, accounts for
heteroskedastic noise, we are able to build our photometric parallax
model---which is a model of the \cmd---using
all the data, not just the data with the highest signal-to-noise.
So, the generated model for the \cmd\ is representative for
our subset of the \tgas\ Catalog.
Because our model is representitive of our full subset catalog, we expect any (sensible) parallax estimates
we generate from our parallax posterior pdfs to be only weakly biased.

\subsection{Comparison with other priors}
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{comparePrior.png}
\caption{Comparison with a common spatial prior: A visualization of the posterior pdf for a subsection of \tgas\ stars, shown as the expectation value and the sqrt of the variance as the uncertainty. Left panel shows the posterior pdf using our \cmd\ prior, right panel shows the posterior pdfs when using the exponentially declining spatial density, a common space-density prior used when inferring distances. The scale of the exponentially declining spatial density prior is $1.35~{\rm kpc}$, the optimal value found in \cite{astraatmadja16a}. Using the \cmd\ as a prior generates a posterior pdf that has smaller variance.}
\label{fig:comparePrior}
\end{figure}

There are other options for prior information to include when inferring distances to stars.
One option is the exponentially declining spatial density (EDSD) of stars \citep{astraatmadja16a}.
It is parameterized by a scale length, and has the nice property that it is smooth out to very large distances so that the posteriors are also very smooth.
It is a fairly weak prior.
It sets a smooth scale distance beyond which the posterior struggles to maintain much probability, and also converts a negative parallax likelihood into a posterior of very small parallax.
\figurename~\ref{fig:comparePrior} shows a comparison of the EDSD prior with our \cmd\ prior.
Here the parallax posterior pdf expectation value and square root of the variance is converted into an absolute magnitude and visualized as the \cmd.
The left panel visualizes results using our \cmd\ prior, and the right panel visualizes results using the EDSD prior.
The variance for the \cmd\ prior is significantly smaller than the variance for the EDSD prior.
In general, it is a fairly broad prior so the median \gaia\ star has a posterior variance equal to the likelihood variance.
It has the largest effect on the most noisy and negative parallaxes, and has the nice property of bringing these noisy or negative measurements to reasonable parallaxes.

\subsection{What's That Feature?}
The denoised expectation values of the parallax projected into the \cmd\ show many interesting and familiar features; we visualize this \cmd\ again in \figurename~\ref{fig:wtf} and highlight some of these features.
\begin{figure}
\centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{whatsThatFeature.pdf}
\caption{Features in the \cmd: The expectation values from the posterior pdfs of the true parallax}
\label{fig:wtf}
\end{figure}

The lower main sequence is very narrow while the upper main sequence
is much wider. This may be an age variation on the main sequence mixed
with a Malmquist bias of seeing a much larger volume of upper main
sequence stars. There is a plausible binary sequence of stars with
about twice the brightness as the main sequence. The helium burning
red clump is prominent for the volume DR1 probed, and the red giant
branch is fairly straight and narrow. The main sequence turn off is
noticeable and also surprisingly narrow, possibly a reflection of the
star formation history of the local volume also mixed with a Malmquist
bias.

\subsection{Critical discussion of assumptions}

In Section~\ref{sec:method} we listed a set of assumptions upon which
the photometric parallax method in this project is based.
Here we return to these assumptions, and discuss them critically in more
detail, under the same set of assumption labels:
\begin{description}
\item[stationarity]
  We have assumed that (locally) the morphology of
  the \cmd\ is independent of signal-to-noise; that is, we have assumed that
  both the low and high
  signal-to-noise objects are being drawn from the same distribution.
  This isn't precisely true because nearby stars in \tgas\ are
  mostly main sequence stars, while we can see luminous giants to much larger
  distances. So the red giant branch is a population of
  relatively lower signal-to-noise objects compared with the main
  sequence. This does not violate the stationarity assumption in
  detail, because the low and high signal-to-noise objects have to be
  drawn from the same distribution within some feature or patch of the
  \cmd\ space.
\item[selection] The biggest limitation of our method for generating
  the \cmd\ from the data is that we have not used a
  \tgas\ selection function, completeness estimate, or
  inverse-selection-volume corrections.  This model is a model of the
  \tgas\ Catalog (or really the \tgas--\tmass\ intersection), not of
  the stars in the Milky Way, nor any volume-limited subsample of the
  Milky Way.  Importantly, because we used \emph{all} of the stars in
  the \tgas--\tmass\ intersection, the model \emph{is} representive of
  the full intersection, even the distant parts, where all the
  parallaxes are measured at low signal-to-noise.  This is in contrast
  to techniques that might build the model from only the high
  signal-to-noise sources; such a model would be biased towards
  stellar types and compositions found locally, as well as
  lower-luminosity stars, and stars which happened to get good
  parallaxes.  However, our use of the entire
  \tgas--\tmass\ intersection without any selection function restricts
  the use of our \cmd\ model as a prior to inferences within that same
  \tgas--\tmass\ intersection.  It would be biasing to use this same
  prior to infer distances for the full billion-star catalog released
  in \gaia\ DR1 alongside \tgas, or for stars fainter or brighter or
  bluer than those included in the \tgas--\tmass\ intersection.
\item[big data] The empirical Bayesian methodology is a good
  approximation to full hierarchical inference in the limit of large
  numbers of data points, such that no individual star is carrying a
  lot of weight in the model of the \cmd.  With its millions of stars,
  the \tgas\ Catalog appears to safely live in this limit.  However,
  because there are parts of the \cmd\ that are poorly populated, even
  in \tgas, the empirical Bayes approximation may be bad for some
  portions of the \cmd.  In particular, there appear to be essentially
  no white dwarf stars, and other classes (like bright red giant
  branch stars) have few to no exemplars in the data set at high
  signal-to-noise (in parallax).  For all these reasons, we do think
  that this approximation is not perfectly safe, and it is a goal to
  explore full hierarchical modeling in the coming years (and see, for
  example, \citealt{leistedtHogg2017}).
\item[noise model] Everything in both the establishment of the data-driven
  prior and the use of it for parallax inference has been done under the deep
  assumption that the \gaia\ noise model is correct. If the
  uncertainties are over-estimated then we could be over-deconvolving.
  That is, the data-driven model could be producing a tighter or more
  informative distribution than what would truly be observed in a much
  higher signal-to-noise experiment or survey. That is, incorrect uncertainty
  estimates will bias the empirical-Bayes prior we obtain. On the inference
  side, wrong uncertainty estimates lead to further biases in the derived photometric parallaxes.
\item[dust] Within our probabilistic framework, we improperly handle
  dust. We are taking a point estimate of the probabilistic dust model
  at a quantile of our distance posterior, correcting our photometry
  using this point estimate, and then re-deriving the prior. A full,
  proper account would sample the dust model at distances sampled from
  the posterior, and propagate those samples back into the prior
  during the iterative process. The reason we don't do a full
  probabilistic treatment, is that this proper dust distribution would
  not be a Gaussian distribution, which \xd\ requires. We could
  calculate this more complex dust distribution and estimate it as a
  Gaussian distribution to feed to \xd, however, this is beyond the
  scope of this paper.
\item[mixture of Gaussians] The \cmd\ model is a mixture of Gaussians,
  and furthermore fixed at $K=128$ components. This setting was chosen
  after some experimentation as being able to capture features but still
  be easily optimized. We performed some experiments
  that suggest that larger $K$ would lead to better models, even in the
  conservative sense of cross-validation score. Choosing an optimized or
  optimal number for this mixture is a natural extension of this work.

  Beyond this, the choice of the Gaussian form itself for the mixture is
  questionable. The Gaussian has great properties, that we capitalize on
  both at the prior-generation stage (with \xd), and at the photometric-parallax
  stage (capitalizing on Gaussian product rules). We could move to other
  forms, but they would be extremely expensive, computationally.
\item[no physics] Although it is presented as an advantage of our
  method that we never make any use of physical models, it is also
  brings some significant disadvantages: For example, the \cmd\ contains
  features that are obvious products of stellar evolution, but doesn't in
  itself inform the theory or models of stellar evolution, because our
  mixture-of-Gaussian \cmd\ model is divorced from any theoretical ideas
  about stars. For another, stellar evolution models are in fact very
  predictive and successful; our model does not capitalize in any way on
  those successes. A next-generation model might be designed to be data-driven
  but nonetheless capitalize on physics-driven successes. One framework
  for that would be to fit not the \cmd\ but rather deviations of the \cmd\ away
  from a good physics-based model prediction.
\end{description}



The outputs of this project include posterior pdfs for stellar parallaxes.
It is tempting to treat these outputs as equivalent to some kind of catalog of
measurements, as we treated the original parallax measurements from \tgas.
That is, it is tempting to treat these as simply ``better'' measurements.
Taken one star at a time, this is permitted and true, and the basis for our
claim that we have de-noised the \tgas\ Catalog.
However, there are important differences, as there are with all
probabilistic catalogs (\citealt{hogg11}; \citealt{portillo17}), between the
original \tgas\ measurements and the de-noised measurements.
For users of our output, the most important difference between our
output and the \tgas\ data input is that the \tgas\ data is the representation
of a likelihood function, whereas our ouptut is a
representation of a posterior pdf, one per star.
Posterior information used naively can lead to serious statistical
errors, because each data point has had a prior multiplied in.
Multiplicative uses of the data will effectively take the prior
pdf to a large power.
We have (in previous work)
given examples of correct uses of posterior samplings or pdfs
for subsequent inferences (\citealt{hogg08}; \citealt{dfm14}); we
encourage power-users to consult those methodological
contributions before engaging with these outputs.
